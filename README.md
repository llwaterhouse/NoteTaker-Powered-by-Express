## Description
* Note Taker has a simple graphical interface that anyone can use where they are to jot down reminders and then bring them up to read at a later time.

* When starting the application, the user is presented with a landing page that tells them the name of the app with a button that will bring them to the notes page.

* The first time the app is used, the left hand column will be empty.  After the user enters a Note Title and Note Text, a save icon appears and they can save their note. The title will be displayed in a list on the left hand side.

* When the user selects a saved Note, it appears in the main window.  There is a trashcan icon next to each note so the user may delete items if they want.

* If the user closes the app and then re-opens it later, all the saved notes are restored.

* The final app is deployed to Heroku.
